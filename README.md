# SOLID Principles Examples

This repository provides practical examples of the SOLID principles applied in TypeScript. Each example demonstrates how to implement and adhere to one or more of the SOLID principles to create maintainable and scalable code.

## SOLID Principles

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Each class should have only one reason to change.
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering correctness.
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
